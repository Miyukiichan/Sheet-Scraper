# SheetScraper

## Overview

Work in progress at the moment but the goal of this is to scrape URLs from a list of the same website and then add them to a google sheet, filling in existing columns as required

## Todo

- Move scraping to the controller
- Starting column/row
- Have gaps between the fields
- Table in options for field definitions
- Arrange UI
- Limit to being the same website as per the config
- Save data to a spreadsheet when press the go button
- Options file IO
- List file IO
- CLI options
- Testing mode that outputs results to the screen instead of updating the spreadsheet
